# Project State: LSPs

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Every @chillwhales/* package installs cleanly, works in any JS/TS environment (ESM and CJS), and ships with correct types — consumers never think about compatibility.

**Current Focus:** All 19 plans complete. Milestone v1.0 ready.

## Current Position

**Phase:** 8 (External Code Extraction)
**Plan:** 3 of 3 in phase
**Status:** Milestone complete
**Last activity:** 2026-03-01 — Completed 08-03 lsp1, erc725, integration

**Progress:** [██████████] 100%

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions
- Roadmap uses 8 phases (comprehensive depth) derived from natural requirement boundaries
- failOnWarn: true fix prioritized as Phase 1 (most dangerous existing debt per research)
- Code quality (Biome) separated from dependency hygiene (knip, sherif) — different concerns
- Commitlint grouped with Biome/hooks (Phase 2) since both use simple-git-hooks
- Coverage infrastructure (Phase 4) separated from CI (Phase 5) — coverage must work locally before CI reports it
- External extraction is Phase 8 (last) — requires stable, published packages
- Config package uses direct .ts exports (no build step) — unbuild/vitest consume TS natively
- Single default pnpm catalog (no named catalogs) — all 8 shared deps meet 2+ package threshold
- tsconfig.base.json at config package root (extends resolves via filesystem, not Node exports)
- failOnWarn: true as createBuildConfig default — Plan 02 handles transition
- No build warnings existed — failOnWarn: true transition was seamless (no fixes needed)
- All 8 packages use identical thin wrapper pattern (no per-package overrides needed)
- tsconfig extends uses @chillwhales/config/tsconfig (exports map key), not tsconfig.base.json directly
- Vitest 4.x test.projects used instead of deprecated vitest.workspace.ts
- vitest added to root devDependencies for root-level test runner (pnpm strict isolation)
- All Biome formatting defaults (tabs, 80 width, double quotes, trailing commas) — zero explicit overrides in biome.json
- noExplicitAny disabled in test files — as any is standard pattern for type guard testing
- Single root biome.json governs all packages — no per-package configs
- simple-git-hooks over husky — simpler config, package.json-based, zero boilerplate
- commitlint.config.mjs (not .js) — root lacks type:module so CJS default breaks ESM export
- pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies for simple-git-hooks — pnpm v10 strict build policy
- check renamed to check:lint, check becomes umbrella (biome → sherif → knip → madge) — fastest to slowest
- Inter-package cycles only for madge — intra-package cycles are each package's internal concern
- deps-graph.svg gitignored — on-demand developer visualization, not committed
- knip: packages/config gets includeEntryExports (private), library packages don't (barrel exports are public API)
- knip auto-detects entry points from package.json exports — redundant entries removed from knip.json
- Zero unused deps/exports/files across all workspace packages — codebase was already clean
- packages/config excluded from coverage — no testable logic (only defineProject/defineBuildConfig wrappers)
- typecheck script filters both root workspace and config package — root has no tsconfig, config has no src
- publint --strict and attw --pack used in CI despite current warnings — Phase 6 fixes package metadata
- codecov.yml in repo root with patch coverage 80%, project threshold 2%, ignore packages/config
- Build artifacts passed via upload/download-artifact for CI Layer 3 jobs
- Coverage uploaded from Node 24 only via conditional artifact upload in test matrix
- publint --strict and attw --pack failures confirmed as FalseCJS type issues — Phase 6 scope
- knip ignoreBinaries for tsc — runs via pnpm -r exec in package context, not root
- ESM-only build output — removed rollup.emitCJS, no CJS files generated
- Removed main field from all packages — exports map takes precedence, main caused attw CJSResolvesToESM
- attw --profile esm-only in CI — skips CJS resolution modes for ESM-only packages
- @changesets/changelog-github for PR-attributed changelogs with author credit
- cancel-in-progress: false on release workflow — partial publish is dangerous, retry is recovery
- privatePackages { version: false, tag: false } to skip @chillwhales/config
- Build step before changesets/action so dist/ artifacts exist for publish
- pkg-pr-new with --compact --comment=update --packageManager=pnpm for clean PR preview comments
- Fork guard (head.repo.full_name == github.repository) blocks external PRs from snapshot access
- Reserved prefix changed from 0x0030 to 0x0031 to match LSP31 standard number
- LICENSE committed permanently in all packages instead of dynamic copy at pack time
- LSP17 prefix inlined as constant instead of adding @lukso/lsp17contractextension-contracts dep
- getData uses inline minimal ERC725Y ABI instead of importing full universalprofile-contracts ABI
- NftMetadata extends LSP4Metadata with optional token fields instead of separate type
- LSP26 noted as candidate for future @chillwhales/lsp26 package (4 functions from marketplace)
- LSP1 typeId constants sourced from LUKSO docs, validated against lsp-indexer universalReceiver plugin patterns
- ERC725Y data-key utilities created fresh following LSP2 spec rather than extracting coupled lsp-indexer code
- lsp-indexer metadata parsing documented as migration opportunity for @chillwhales/lsp3, lsp4, lsp29 parsers

### Research Flags
- Phase 7 (Release Automation): npm scope claim, NPM_TOKEN setup, first-publish dry-run — needs phase research
- Phase 8 (External Extraction): Must audit marketplace and lsp-indexer repos — needs phase research
- ~~Pre-existing: 10 test failures in @chillwhales/lsp29~~ — RESOLVED in 04-01 (fixtures aligned with Zod schema)
- Pre-existing: Vitest v4 configs fail to load on Node v20 (ESM compat issue) — tests only run on Node v24+

### Pending TODOs
- None yet

### Known Blockers
- None yet
